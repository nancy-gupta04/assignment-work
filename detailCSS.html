			<h4>
				CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
				CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
				CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
				External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
			</h4>
			<h3>CSS syntax</h3>
			<h4>
				The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
				The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
				Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
				Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

							<p>
							we use CSS cards technique in this project with the help of nested div tags, class in HTML and attributed in CSS using various properties.
								Cards are a convenient means of displaying content composed of different types of objects.
								Theyâ€™re also well-suited for presenting similar objects whose size or supported actions can vary considerably,
								like photos with captions of variable length.
                             </p>

						<h1>Flex </h1>

						<div>
							<p>
								CSS flexbox layout allows us to easily format HTML. Flexbox makes it simple to align items vertically and horizontally using rows and columns. 
								Items will "flex" to different sizes to fill the space. It makes responsive design easier.
                                CSS flexbox is great to use for the general layout of the website.

						<h1>Transition </h1>

						<div>
							<p>These transition properties allow elements to change values over a specified duration,
							animating the property changes, rather than having them occur immediately.
							CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.
                            Mouse over the element below to see a CSS transition effect.

							<p>
								The :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.
								CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
								With CSS we added shadow to text and to elements.
								The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
