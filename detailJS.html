			<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
			
			<h4>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
			While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js,
			Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, 
			imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

								A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
                                In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
                                 A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

								The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
                                The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.Ex. (var x = (100 + 50) * a;)

								A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
                                A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
